# Leave_Policies

## There are different types of leave policies. We will be focusing on maternity and paternity leave

# What is Maternity and Paternity Leave?
## Maternity Leave is a period in time when a mother takes time off of work after child birth or in some cases adoption, on average for about 12 weeks but can be as long as a year.
## Paternity Leave is a period in time when a father is granted absence from work after or shortly after the birth of a child.
The U.S doesn’t have a national paid family leave policy. The length of maternity and paternity leave depends on many factors, including where you live, your company’s paid leave policies, whether you qualify for unpaid benefits under the FMLA (Family & Medical Leave Act) and how much unpaid time you can afford to take.

# The Ask
- How many companies provide paid and unpaid leave?
- What is the total amount of companies offering them?
- What are the top industries for paid and unpaid leave?
- What are some of the companies that are already offering them?

- An idea of many companies actually offer them.
- Industries to aim for when considering a career.
- Which company you might have heard of and interested in already to apply to.

# Stakeholders
- HR
- Companies to stay competitive
- Future Prospective Employees

# Data Collection
## I obtained the dataset from kaggle. I picked leave policies because I found it interesting as I am thinking about starting a family in the near future. The accuracy of the data was labeled good.

# Tools Used
## I used SQL Big Query to clean the data and for the data transformation. I check for nullable fields in the company and industry fields. The fields for paternity and maternity had N/A as the value to substitute for empty fields. I decided to make them blank so they can be a factor in my analysis. I used Tableau for my analysis and visualization.
